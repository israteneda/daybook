I'm using [Duoling](https://www.duolingo.com) (Every Day) and [Elsa Speak](https://elsaspeak.com/) to improve my English.

An awesome website that I use time to time (that's great for speaking) is [free4talk.com](https://www.free4talk.com/)

I'll prepare to take IELTS Academic exam, to grow as professional.
