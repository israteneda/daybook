# Daybook

This is a compilation of ideas, lessons learned and areas in which I want to improve.
Te idea behind this website is to have a record of all the knowledge I gather as a developer.
Ideally, I'll add content on a daily basis. This site is inspired by [Engineering Daybooks - The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/9780135956977/f_0041.xhtml)

## What am I going to talk about?

1. [English](english/introduction.md)
2. [Algorithms and Interview Prep](algorithms/introduction.md)
3. [Python and Software Dev](dev/introduction.md)
