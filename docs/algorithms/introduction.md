I'm going to start reading [Grooking Algorithms](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-algorithms/9781617292231)

I'll start solving problems in [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/) and updating this [repo](https://github.com/israteneda/algorithms) with the solutions.

An interesting repo that I'd like to take a look is [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)
