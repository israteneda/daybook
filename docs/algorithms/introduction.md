I'm going to start reading [Grooking Algorithms](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-algorithms/9781617292231)

Two other books I'd like to read:
 - [Elements of Programming Interviews in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders-ebook-dp-B09X5D8NDY/dp/B09X5D8NDY/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)
 - [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)

I'll start solving problems in [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/) and updating this [repo](https://github.com/israteneda/algorithms) with the solutions. [Recommended exercises to solve](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75)

An interesting repo that I'd like to take a look is [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)

An intresting website to learn algorithms is [algo.monster](https://algo.monster/)

After some time without progess (because I didn't put enough effort). I'll start checking this site: [techinterviewhandbook](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/) along with [Grokking Algorithms]((https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/grokking-algorithms/9781617292231)) book
